#  Student Data

## Discoveries

### During the development of the challenge, some data were found that are important to highlight. For example, the large number of rows with null information, which can generate conclusions that do not represent the population studied 100%. The next curious fact is to know the size of the schools depending on the number of students that are there, concluding that there are schools of all sizes, with a range of about 200 students to about 2000. Finally, it is interesting that in the math score calculation charter school students have a higher average than their peers in public schools, with the exception of grade 12 where public schools have a higher average.

## Additional Analysis

### An additional analysis that could have been done would be not to eliminate the null data but to replace it with the mean of the known data and to carry out the same experiment carried out here to study the differences in both cases. It would also have been interesting to study how the mean of the reading score varies by grade and type of school and see if the behavior is similar to that found in the math score or if it differs drastically.
